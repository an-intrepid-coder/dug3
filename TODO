- Automatic testing in general.

- Improve AI pathfinding around diagonals and hallway entrances.

- Fix occasional enemies spawning in the walls.

- Exception handling throughout the codebase.

- More AI types.
  * SENTRY: Like WAITING_HUNTER, but always returns to its spawn point
            as soon as it loses sight of the player.
  * PATROL: Moves between waypoints when player is not in sight; otherwise
            chases player.

  * Confusion (random wander for x turns).
  * Regeneration (heal 1-ish hp for x turns).
    ** Make trolls regenerate.

- Shift-move and auto-explore

- Traps, Secret Doors, and Searching.

- Manual seeding.

- Vision radius as a modifier

- Rect class instead of struct.

- Coord class instead of struct.

- Generic version of PriorityQueueCoord.

- Persistent High Score List

- Character Menu

- BSP level gen.

- Cellular Automata level gen.

- Maze level gen.

- Ranged combat && TAB targeting.

- AI pathfinding accounts for other actors in the Dijkstra map.

- Equipment System
  * gear system
  * equip and unequip
  * equipment menu (similar to inventory menu)

- Movement between levels in a persistent way
  * Upstairs as well as downstairs movement and level generation.

- Persistence / Save-states

- Town level

- Multi-page menus

- Multiple races/classes

- "Cinematic" uses of ncurses.

- Bestiary system & Procedural Enemy Type Generation.

- Graphical Tiles.

- Genetic Algorithms. They could come in handy in several ways for a
  Roguelike.

(and much more eventually)

~-~~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
- full auto-explore

- AI for the player (for auto-testing and observation).

- Automatic testing in general.

- More AI types.
  * SENTRY: Like WAITING_HUNTER, but always returns to its spawn point
            as soon as it loses sight of the player.
  * PATROL: Moves between waypoints when player is not in sight; otherwise
            chases player.
  ^-- Both of the above require implementing a path memory property for
      Actors.

- Makefiles in order to speed up recompilation.

- Exception handling throughout the codebase.

- More monsters.
  * Imp (cause poison or confusion on hit sometimes).
  * Minotaur (does bonus damage, high HP, mini-boss).

  * Poison (dmg per turn for x turns).
  * Amnesia (re-conceals the map).
  * Teleport (random relocation).
  * Confusion (random wander for x turns).
  * Regeneration (heal 1-ish hp for x turns).
    ** Make trolls regenerate.
